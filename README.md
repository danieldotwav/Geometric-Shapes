# Geometric-Shapes
This C++ program showcases the concept of object-oriented programming through the implementation of two classes, Rectangle and Box. These classes represent geometric shapes and provide various functionalities related to their properties.

# Key Features:

Rectangle Class: Represents a rectangle with methods to set its dimensions, calculate area and perimeter, and print its details.

Box Class: Inherited from Rectangle, represents a three-dimensional rectangular prism (box) with methods to set its dimensions, calculate volume and surface area, and print its details.

Object-Oriented Approach: Demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, including inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.

User Interaction: Allows users to input dimensions for both rectangle and box objects and displays their properties.
